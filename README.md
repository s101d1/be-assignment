# <b>REST API Backend that manages userâ€™s accounts and transactions (send/withdraw)</b>

The backend is built with [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) framework.

JWT is used for authentication by using [fastify/jwt](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-jwt) plugin.

The SQL database connection is handled by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM library.

## <b> Getting Started </b>

### Requirements

* Node v18+
* Docker
* PostgreSQL (if you want to run the app without docker)

### How to run the app without docker

* Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

* Prepare a PostgreSQL database instance and modify the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in `.env` file accordingly.

* Create the database schema:
    ```bash
    $ npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    $ npx prisma generate
    ```

* Run the app:
    ```bash
    $ npm run dev
    ```

    The server will run at http://localhost:3000
